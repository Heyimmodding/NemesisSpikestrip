Slight tweaks and rebalances to [Spikestrip 2.0](https://thunderstore.io/package/SpikestripModding/Spikestrip2_0/) elites that hopefully makes them closer in power to vanilla elites.

also check out [Nemesis Rising Tides](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/Nemesis_RisingTides/) for even more based elites.

## T1: Plated Elite
- Reworked: Upon damage, increases its stack. only the 6th attack deals damage and resets the stack.
- On death, provides small amounts of armor to enemies around itself. (buff to compensate)
- Stack is visible in health, hopefully makes the effect less frustrating to deal with.

You might want to **disable / "zero out" ZetAspects settings** if this setting is on, as plated elites become absolutely unkillable early game with this combined.

## T1: Warped Elite
- Reduced bubble effect duration in general. (general nerf)
- Ability to "break out" faster by not moving (up to 2x, configurable)  

Note: Might still be too close to [Aquamarine](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/Nemesis_RisingTides/) elites? let me know if you have a better rework idea (3). I think theyre distinct enough though considering veiled / celestine. different tiers too

## T1: Veiled Elite
- Increased distortion VFX. this hopefully allows keen eyes users to spot invisible enemy.
- Enemy is visible for a short period upon taking damage. this is to encourage focusing down on a revealed enemy.
- [Assassins](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/RecoveredAndReformed/) cannot be veiled as they can inherently go invisible.

## T2: Aragonite Elite
- Attack does not trigger off attacking drones / followers.
- Renamed affix equipment name.

## Other changes
- compatibility with affix-in-logbook mods ([WolfoQoL](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/WolfoQualityOfLife/), [ZetArtifacts](https://thunderstore.io/package/William758/ZetArtifacts/)) and better-description mods such as [BetterUI](https://thunderstore.io/package/XoXFaby/BetterUI/).
- Miscellaneous name changes.
